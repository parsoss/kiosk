This **Kiosk Menu Ordering UI** project, developed as part of a hackathon, provides an AI-powered voice ordering experience ideal for cafes, restaurants, or any self-service setting. Built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, it uses **Google Speech-to-Text (STT)** for voice recognition and **OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini** model for menu recommendations, allowing customers to interact hands-free with a digital menu.

## Project Enhancements
- **Voice-Activated Ordering**: By pressing the "Voice Order" button on the menu page, users activate Google STT, allowing them to add items to their order through voice commands.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: OpenAI’s GPT-4o-mini model suggests menu items

## Core Features
- **Category Filtering**: Users can filter menu items by categories like Coffee, Ade, Tea, and Dessert.
- **Menu Selection and Ordering**: An input box allows users to specify their orders (by voice input), including item names and quantities.
- **Order Summary**: Displays the user’s order in a list format, with a "Place Order" button to finalize the selection.

## How to Use
1. **Start**: Click the "Start" button to begin the ordering process.
2. **Category Selection**: Use category buttons to browse and filter items.
3. **Voice Ordering**: Press the "Voice Order" button, then speak your order (e.g., "Americano 3, Croissant 2"). Google STT will recognize the command and add it to the order list.
4. **Recommendations**: The system provides suggestions based on the order using GPT-4-turbo, enhancing the user experience with relevant item ideas
